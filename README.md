This module is a replacement for node's http module (server only). It can be used to build FastCGI applications or to convert existing node applications to FastCGI.

The implementation is fully compliant with [FastCGI 1.0 Specification](http://www.fastcgi.com/drupal/node/6?q=node/22).


Example
-------

```javascript
var fcgi = require('node-fastcgi');

fcgi.createServer(function(req, res) {
  if (req.method === 'GET') {
    res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
    res.end("It's working");
  } else {
    res.writeHead(501);
    res.end();
  }
}).listen();
```

http module compatibility
-------------------------

The API is almost compatible with http module api v0.10.23

Differences:
  - A FastCGI server will never emit `'checkContinue'` and `'connect'` events because `CONNECT` method and `Expect: 100-continue` headers should be handled by the front-end http server
  - The `'upgrade'` event is not currently implemented. Typically upgrade/websocket requests won't work with FastCGI applications because of input/output buffering.
  - `server.listen()` can be called without arguments to listen on the default FastCGI socket `{ fd: 0 }`
  - `server.maxHeadersCount` is useless
  - `request.socket` is not a real socket. It's an object containing HTTP server and client address and port (localAddress, localPort, remoteAddress, remotePort properties)
  - `request.trailers` will always be empty: CGI scripts never receive trailers
  - `response.writeContinue()` works as expected but should not be used. See first item
